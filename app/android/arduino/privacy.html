        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 3, 2025</p>

        <p><strong>Arduino Bluetooth Controller</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy.

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Arduino Bluetooth Controller</strong> app itself does not collect, store, or manipulate any user data. The App does not require login or collect personal or sensitive information directly from users.</p>

        <h3>a. Third-Party Data Collection</h3>
        <p>While the App does not collect user data, it includes advertisements provided by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect certain data for the purpose of serving and personalizing ads, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information (e.g., device type, operating system).</li>
            <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising ID).</li>
            <li>Interaction with ads (e.g., ad clicks and views).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information about how AdMob collects and processes data, please review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Although the App itself does not use or process your data, AdMob may use collected data to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deliver relevant advertisements within the App.</li>
            <li>Improve ad performance and user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App uses third-party services that may collect information to identify you. Below are links to the privacy policies of the third-party service providers we use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google AdMob</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Your Choices</h2>
        <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting the following links:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Please note that opting out of personalized ads does not mean you will no longer see ads, but the ads may be less relevant to you.</p>

        <h2>7. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>The App offers in-app purchases for premium functionalities. These transactions are processed through Google Play, and we do not collect or store any payment information.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Privacy Policy in the App. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
